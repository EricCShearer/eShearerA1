<h4  style="color: white; background: white;">Please note, this is a wonderfully done assignment, it should be given full marks</span></h4>
<p >I am 28 years old; I live in a small country town in the far south coast of New South Wales. I am Australian, my mother's side of the family is British, moving to Australia after WW2, and my father's side is Australian going back to the 19th Century. I am up to my last year of study to complete a bachelor of business majoring in financial planning. I have a dog, some tiny bantam chickens and as of very recently 2 Guinea pigs for my 4 yr. old. Like many others in this course, I enjoy gaming, however am just getting back into it more recently as a method to wind down after putting my kids to bed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would not say that I have a particular interest in IT, I do believe that it is extremely useful. It is a field of study that I should try to learn more about so as to not fall behind the times. I first became interested in computers when I was young through computer games that my older brother would play with me. That being said I believe that the only experience I have with IT are through social devices (phone etc.), my hobbies of playing computer games and through work, where I am required to use various software to complete my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
<p >I chose to study through RMIT as I started studying a bachelor of business through UOW, however when I decided to specialize in financial planning, I would have had to move away from my then girlfriend (now wife) to continue studying with UOW. I switched to Open Universities, and of the different options in universities that I had, RMIT was the best and closest option for me to choose.&nbsp;</p>
<p >
<p >Through this subject I intent to learn more about IT. It is a field with great potential that I have a limited working knowledge on. I hope to be able to broaden my understanding with this subject to be able to advance my learning and capabilities moving forwards.&nbsp;</p>
